# Flight Price Prediction â€“ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

This repository contains the data preprocessing pipeline for a Flight Price Prediction project. The goal is to clean the raw dataset and perform feature engineering to make it suitable for machine learning models.

## Project Overview

Predicting flight prices is a classic regression problem in data science. Before training any models, the raw data must be properly cleaned and transformed. This notebook focuses on:

- Understanding the structure of the dataset
- Cleaning missing or inconsistent data
- Extracting and transforming date/time-related features
- Encoding categorical variables
- Creating meaningful numerical features
- Preparing the final dataset for ML training

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- NumPy
- seaborn & matplotlib (for visualization)

## Contents

- `Flight-price-data-cleaning-feature-eng.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all data cleaning and feature engineering steps.

## Dataset

> **Note**: The dataset used in this project is assumed to be publicly available or provided for educational purposes. Please ensure that the dataset is present in the working directory when running the notebook.

Typical features include:
- Date of Journey
- Departure and Arrival Time
- Airline, Source, and Destination
- Carrier Code, Flight Number
- Duration
- Number of Stops
- Price (target)

## Tasks Completed

- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Cleaned null or inconsistent entries
- Extracted useful features (e.g., day, month, hour)
- Encoded categorical features using label/one-hot encoding
- Finalized a clean dataset ready for ML modeling

## Next Steps

- Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance
